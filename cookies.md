<p>On our website we use cookies and other similar tools in order to improve the performance and for enhanced user experience. The policy detailed below explains how we do this.</p>

<h2>So what are cookies?</h2>

<p>Cookies are basically a type of mechanism to both store and retrieve information when one visits a website or simply put they are small text files which a website uses to function correctly and give&nbsp; best user experience possible. Cookies are stored on your computer, tablet or a mobile device when you first visit a site or page.</p>

<p>Some web pages in a website and HTML based emails may also contain a small snippet of code called a Web Beacon. Simply put, Web Beacons allow a website to transfer or collect information through a graphic image request. Websites use Web Beacons and cookies for many purposes, including site usage analytics, auditing advertisement investment and reporting, content and target audience personalisation.</p>

<p>In our cookie policy we use the term &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way including Web Beacons.</p>

<p>Some cookies focus on personalization and giving better user experience, for example when a user clicks &ldquo;remember me&rdquo; when logging in, a cookie will store username. Most cookies do not collect information that identifies you. They collect general information such as how a users arrived at the websites, or a user&rsquo;s general location.</p>

<h2>What sort of cookies does the New Aspect Media use?</h2>

<p>Generally, our cookies perform up to four different functions:</p>

<h2>First-party cookies (cookies set by us)</h2>

<h2>1. Essential cookies</h2>

<p>These are cookies which are essential for the operation of our website. These may allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they can access the subscription only pages. The subscriber of course has the choice to disable these cookies following which the user will not be able to access all of the content that a subscription entitles them to.</p>

<h2>2. Performance Cookies</h2>

<p>Our website uses other cookies to analyze and monitor performance which in turn provides a better user experience. With the analysis and monitoring of our website performance we can offer better experience to our customers in the future such as optimizing the pages, links and forms on the website.</p>

<h2>3. Functionality Cookies</h2>

<p>Our website uses functionality cookies to allow us to remember your preferences. As an example, these cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you access our website, or&nbsp; recall your customization preferences, provide you with enhanced services such as allowing you to watch a video, comment on a blog etc.</p>

<h2>4. Behaviourally Targeted Advertising Cookies</h2>

<p>The New Aspect Media and our advertisers use cookies to serve you with advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests. For example, if you read a number of articles on motoring on New Aspect Media.com or on other sites, a car manufacturer might infer you are interested in this topic and serve you with its car advertisements. You might see these advertisements on New Aspect Media.com and on other sites that you visit. However, we do not tell our advertisers who you are.</p>
